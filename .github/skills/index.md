# ALDC Skills Catalog

## What are Skills?

Skills are composable knowledge modules in markdown format that agents load on demand based on task context. They encapsulate domain-specific patterns, workflows, and best practices.

Skills follow the GitHub Copilot Agent Skills structure (`skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`). Copilot auto-loads skills based on their `description` frontmatter — agents no longer need `@file` references.

## Creating New Skills

1. Create folder `skills/skill-{domain}/`
2. Copy `docs/templates/skill-template.md` to `skills/skill-{domain}/SKILL.md`
3. Fill in all sections (including frontmatter with `name` and `description`)
4. Keep under 500 lines (context window optimization)
5. Submit PR (required skills need RFC approval)

## Shared review procedure

[skill-al-review-pipeline](skill-al-review-pipeline/SKILL.md) is used by Developer Reviewer, the Conductor review subagent and Dredd. It separates execution, coverage and index generation.
