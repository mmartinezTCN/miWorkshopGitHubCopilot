description: Scope and evidence conventions for the OctoberWorkshops AL increment.
applyTo: "**/*.al"
---

Use the approved increment specification as the source of business behavior. Keep the starter's application version, runtime, object range and naming conventions unless the task explicitly changes them.

Use extension objects and supported integration points when working with standard Business Central objects. Keep new work within the agreed increment.

When returning implementation results, identify the changed files and the compiler or test commands actually executed, including their outcome. Record checks that remain unexecuted separately.

For Customer Follow-up, obtain WorkDate in the UI and pass an explicit reference date to the status function. Apply the approved calendar-day and repeat-action rules. Keep business logic in the codeunit and verify persisted dates after the action.
