# AL Memory File Generator

Generate and maintain a `memory.md` file that serves as the **project memory** - tracking decisions, changes, learnings, and important conversations across development sessions.

## Purpose

The `memory.md` file provides:
- **Session Continuity**: What happened in previous sessions
- **Decision Log**: Why things were done a certain way
- **Problem/Solution Patterns**: What issues occurred and how they were solved
- **TODO Tracking**: What needs to be done next
- **Learning Journal**: Insights gained during development
- **Context for AI**: Prevents re-asking questions or repeating mistakes

This enables AI assistants and developers to pick up where they left off and build on previous work.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Initialize Memory Structure

If `memory.md` doesn't exist, create with this template:

```markdown

[The key insight, pattern, or understanding gained]

**How We Learned It**:
[Through debugging, documentation, experimentation, etc.]

**Why It Matters**:
[Impact on the project, development efficiency, code quality, etc.]

**Where Applied**:

**Best Practice**:
[If this leads to a best practice for this project]

**Resources**:
- [Links to documentation that helped]
- [Code examples from BC or other sources]
```

### 7. Update Quick Reference

At the end of each session, update the top section:

```markdown
## Quick Reference

**Current Focus**: [Update with current work]  
**Last Session**: [Date of last session]  
**Next Steps**: 
1. [Most imMEDIUMte next action]
2. [Second priority]

**Active Blockers**: 
- [Blocker 1]: [Status]

**Recent Achievements** (Last 7 days):
- [Achievement 1]
- [Achievement 2]

**Active Branch**: [Git branch if relevant]
```

### 8. Maintenance & Cleanup

**Weekly:**
- Move completed TODOs to "Done" section
- Archive old session entries (keep last 10, summarize older ones)
- Update code evolution section if major changes

**Monthly:**
- Review decision log - mark outdated decisions
- Consolidate similar problem/solution patterns
- Clean up deprecated patterns section
- Update environment notes if setup changed

## Output Format

Deliver:
1. ✅ Created/updated `memory.md` at project root
2. ✅ Summary of key additions made
3. ✅ Highlight any important patterns/decisions documented
4. ✅ Suggest next session focus based on TODOs

## Integration with Development Workflow

### At Session Start
```markdown
**AI Assistant**: Load memory.md to understand:
- What was done last session
- What the plan was for this session
- Any blockers or important context
```

### During Development
```markdown
**Capture**:
- Decisions as they're made
- Problems as they're encountered
- Learnings as they're discovered
```

### At Session End
```markdown
**Update**:
- Session log with completion status
- TODOs with progress
- Quick Reference with next steps
```

## Key Principles

- **Chronological**: Most recent first for quick access
- **Searchable**: Use clear headings and keywords
- **Contextual**: Include enough context to understand later
- **Actionable**: TODOs and next steps are concrete
- **Honest**: Document failures and mistakes - they're learning opportunities
- **Linked**: Reference files, line numbers, other sections
- **Concise**: Important but brief - detailed docs go in context.md

## Success Criteria

A successful `memory.md` enables:
- ✅ Picking up project after weeks away
- ✅ Understanding why code is the way it is
- ✅ Avoiding repeat mistakes
- ✅ Building on previous learnings
- ✅ Tracking progress over time
- ✅ AI assistant continuity across sessions

## Collaboration

When multiple developers work on the project:
- Each adds their session entries
- Decisions are collaborative - note who participated
- Problem solutions are shared learning
- TODOs can be assigned to people
- Communication log tracks cross-team discussions
