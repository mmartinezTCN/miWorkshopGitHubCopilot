# AL Pull Request Preparation

Your goal is to prepare a **pull request draft** for the branch `${input:Branch}` summarizing all modifications, test evidence, and validation steps.

## 🔒 Human Gate: Pre-PR Review

**Before generating PR draft document:**

1. **Review code changes** - Present summary of all modifications
2. **Security check** - Confirm no sensitive data in commits
3. **Quality validation** - Verify tests pass and build succeeds
4. **Human approval required** - Obtain confirmation before creating PR draft

## Process

### 1. Change Analysis

#### Inspect Branch Differences

Use `codebase` to analyze modifications:
```
codebase: Compare ${input:Branch} with main branch
```

Use `githubRepo` to gather context:
```
githubRepo: Get branch information and commit history
```

**Gather:**
- Modified files and line counts
- New files added
- Deleted files
- Commit messages and references
- Related issues or work items

#### Classify Changes

Categorize into:

1. **New Features** - New AL objects, functionality, APIs
2. **Bug Fixes** - Corrections, refactors, optimizations
3. **Tests** - Test codeunits, scenarios, data
4. **Configuration** - app.json, permissions, dependencies
5. **Documentation** - README, comments, API docs

### 2. Extract Metadata

**Find References:**
Scan commit messages for:
- Issue references (#123)
- Work item IDs
- Requirement numbers

**Pattern matching:**
- Fixes #123
- Closes #456
- Related to WORK-789

**Identify Reviewers:**
If `${input:Reviewer}` is specified, include in the draft.

### 3. Generate PR Draft

Create `/reports/pr-draft.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Pull Request: [Feature/Fix Title]

**Branch:** `${input:Branch}`
**Target:** `main`
**Author:** [Author Name]
**Date:** [Current Date]
