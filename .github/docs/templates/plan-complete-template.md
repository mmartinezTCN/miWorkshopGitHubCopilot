# Template — Plan Completion Report

Use this template verbatim when writing `.github/plans/<plan-name>/<plan-name>-complete.md`. Consolidate data from all phase-complete files. Replace placeholders, remove sections that do not apply, do not invent additional structure.

## Rules

- File name pattern: kebab-case, `<plan-name>-complete.md` (no phase suffix).
- One report per plan, written at the end.
- Reference phase-complete files for detail rather than duplicating their content.
- Skills summary aggregates phase reports; do not invent skills that did not appear in any phase.
- Do not add sections beyond the ones above.
