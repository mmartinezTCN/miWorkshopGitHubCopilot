.SYNOPSIS
    Set up the BCQuality knowledge base for an ALDC workspace (Windows/PowerShell).

.DESCRIPTION
    PowerShell-native equivalent of install.sh. BCQuality is consumed from OUTSIDE
    the AL project (multi-root): this clones it to a sibling folder so its example
    .al files never enter your extension's compilation, then you open
    `aldc.code-workspace` to get it as a second workspace root the agents can read.

    The source is CONFIGURABLE via aldc.yaml (external.bcquality): `url`, `ref` and
    optional `pinnedCommit`. Defaults to the canonical upstream (microsoft/BCQuality);
    point `url` at your own fork to use it instead.

    Run from the ROOT of the repo/folder you run the review/audit on:

        powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\bcquality\install.ps1

    Override the location with the BCQUALITY_HOME environment variable.
